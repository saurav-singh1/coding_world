    <h1>C#</h1>
    <p class="chatch">Just like C++, C# is an object-oriented coding language. However, this coding language came after C++. This programming language was created with the aim to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual basic. C# is certainly the go-to language for Windows application development and Microsoft and not only. If the extension of .Net called Mono is used, then C# can also be used for mobile devices and video game consoles.</p>
    <h2>Benifits & Drawbacks</h2>
    <p class="chatch">C# benefits are numerous. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
    <h3>Fast speed</h3>
    <p class="chatch">C# is a very fast coding language, and the execution time is too quick.</p>
    <h3>Scalable and Updatable</h3>
    <p class="chatch">C# is a scalable and updatable coding language. However, if you want to update it, you have to kill your files and update them with the new one.<p>
    <h3>Rich library</h3>
    <p class="chatch">The rich library of C# language provides a lot of inbuilt functions that fasten the development process.</p>
    <h3>Type-safe</h3>
    <p class="chatch">C# is a type-safe coding language. This means that only the memory location is accessible. This improves the program’s security.</p>
    <h3>Large community support </h3>
    <p class="chatch">C++ is one of the most used coding languages, and as such, has a large community that supports it by bringing out online courses and lectures.
    <p>
    <h3>Cost-benefit</h3>
    <p class="chatch">The cost of maintenance of this language is quite lower when compared to other coding languages.</p>
    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
    <p class="chatch">C# is based on Microsoft .Net framework, and this makes it not as flexible as it could be.</p>
    <h3>Not easy to make in the c# code</h3>
    <p class="chatch">If you need to change anything in the C# written code, then you need to compile it first.</p>
