    <h1>C++</h1>
    <p class="cplus">We can easily say that C++ (originally called C with classes) is one of the oldest and most efficient coding languages still part of the programming realm. This cross-platform, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language is used to create high-performance applications. C++ is the language behind everything from computer games to mathematical simulations</p>
    <h2>Benifits & Drawbacks</h2>
    <p class="cplus">C++ has a number of benefits. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
    <h3>Portability</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ makes it possible for the user to run the same program on different operating systems.</p>
    <h3>Multiple-paradigm</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ is a multi-paradigm coding language. Three paradigms of C++ are generic, imperative, and object-oriented.<p>
    <h3>Low-level manipulation</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ allows low-level data manipulation at a certain level.</p>
    <h3>Scalability</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ is capable of running on all types of data, regardless if they’re a small or a large scale of data.</p>
    <h3>Large community support </h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ is one of the most used coding languages, and as such, has a large community that supports it by bringing out online courses and lectures.

        While it would be great for something to only have benefits. This isn’t possible. So, here are a few disadvantages of C++.
    <p>
    <h3>Absence of garbage collection</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ doesn’t support garbage collection</p>
    <h3>Security issue</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ isn’t secure because of the global variable, friend function, and the pointers it has.</p>
    <h3>Lack of Built-in Threads</h3>
    <p class="cplus">C++ isn’t secure because of the global variable, friend function, and the pointers it has.</p>
