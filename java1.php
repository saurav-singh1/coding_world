        <h1 style="color:brown;">Java</h1>
        <p class="java">Java is one of the most known and widely used programming languages out there. Itâ€™s amongst the
            most used coding languages for Android smartphone applications. Java is an object-oriented, class-based
            programming language and is used to program a number of applications of all devices, starting with mobile
            applications, desktop applications, web applications, games, database connections, and other applications.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:brown;">Benifits & Drawbacks</h2>
        <p class="java">Java, as a programming language, has countless advantages for its users. You can find those
            advantages down below.</p>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">Simple</h3>
        <p class="java">Java is easy to learn and understand. Its syntax is straightforward, easy to learn, maintain,
            and understand.</p>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">Object-oriented programming language</h3>
        <p class="java">As an object-oriented coding language, Java enhances flexibility and reusability of the code,
            increases safety by combining the data binding and functions into a single entity.
        <p>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">Security</h3>
        <p class="java">Java is quite secure. It can reduce security threats and risks by avoiding the use of explicit
            pointers. Java has a security manager for each application that allows defining the access rules for
            classes.

            As for the disadvantages, they are:</p>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">Memory management</h3>
        <p class="java">Java garbage collection manages memory. Whenever the garbage collector functions, it can affect
            the performance of the application.</p>
        <h3 style="color:brown;">performance</h3>
        <p class="java">Java as a coding language is quite memory-consuming and slower in performance compared to other
            natively compiled languages.
        </p>
