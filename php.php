        <p class="php">PHP has certainly many advantages, and we’re going to list them here:</p>
        <h3>No need to write additional code</h3>

        <h3>Works efficiently with databases</h3>
        <p class="php">PHP frameworks make it possible for frameworks to work with multiple relational databases.
        <p>

            As for the disadvantages, PHP too has some:</p>
        <h3>Unsecure programming language</h3>
        <p class="php">Being open-sourced, PHP is considered to be one of the most unsecured programming languages.
        <p>
        <h3>Not suitable for large applications</h3>
        <p class="php">PHP isn’t a modular language and, as such, isn’t suggested to be used to program huge applications. Also, it can’t support a large number of apps.
