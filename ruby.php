        <h1>Ruby</h1>
        <p class="ruby">R is one of the most popular coding languages. It’s used in statistical computing, scientific research, and data analytics. Statisticians, researchers, data analysts, marketers wouldn’t do what they do daily without R. This language is used to retrieve, clean, visualize, analyze, and present data.
        </p>
        <h2>Benifits & Drawbacks</h2>
        <p class="ruby">Here are a few benefits of R coding language:</p>
        <h3>Open-source</h3>
        <p class="ruby">As an open-source programming language, you can use R without having the need for a fee or a license.</p>
        <h3>A large variety of libraries</h3>
        <p class="ruby">R has large community support, and this has resulted in a large collection of libraries. Its libraries are graphical, and they support and enhance the R development environment.
        <p>
        <h3>Data cleansing, data wrangling, and web scraping</h3>
        <p class="ruby">R collects data from the internet through means like web scraping while also performing data cleansing. Not to mention the data wrangling it does.</p>
        <h3>Powerful graphics</h3>
        <p class="ruby">The R libraries are extensive, and as such, they can produce quality graphs and visualizations.

            As for the drawbacks of R, there are some that we can mention.
        <h3>Slow</h3>
        <p class="ruby">The R programs and functions are spread across different packages. This impacts R speed. </p>
        <h3>Poor security</h3>
        <p class="ruby">Unfortunately, R lacks basic security measures. So, you know that it’s not that safe to build web-pages.
