        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p class="python"> Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented coding language. It has dynamic
            semantics. This programming language is simple, with an easy to learn syntax. The reason why many
            programmers fall in love with it is that it can increase productivity. It supports modules and packages,
            which in turn encourages program modularity and code reuse.
        </p>
        <h2>Benifits & Drawbacks</h2>
        <p class="python">Python has a myriad of benefits. We talked about those benefits down below.</p>
        <h3>Improved productivity</h3>
        <p class="python">With the simplicity of the Python coding language, developers won’t have a problem with it.
            Instead, they can focus on solving the problem.</p>
        <h3>Easy to write,read & learn</h3>
        <p class="python">As an object-oriented coding language, Java enhances flexibility and reusability of the code,
            increases safety by combining the data binding and functions into a single entity.
        <p>
        <h3>Free & Open-source</h3>
        <p class="python">Python’s open-source license is OSI approved. For this reason, it’s free to use and
            distribute. You have the right to download, modify, and distribute your version of Python.</p>
        <h3>Vast Libraries Support</h3>
        <p class="python">Python has a large standard library. It has almost all the functions needed for any kind of
            task. In that way, you won’t need to depend on external libraries.

            Even though there are many benefits one can gain from using python, it also has a few disadvantages. Find
            those disadvantages down below.</p>
        <h3>Not memory efficient</h3>
        <p class="python">Python usually uses a large amount of memory. At times, this can be a disadvantage because
            many applications might require memory optimization.
        <p>
        <h3>Database access</h3>
        <p class="python">The access layer of Python’s database is quite underdeveloped compared to other popular
            technologies.
        <p>
        <h3>Runtimes errors</h3>
        <p class="python">Being a dynamically typed language, the data type can change anytime. That’s why it can lead
            to runtime errors.
        <p>
